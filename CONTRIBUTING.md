Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* Require space before the star of generator function (`generator-star-spacing`)
* Getter properties must return a value (`getter-return`)
* Compare to `-0` is an error (`no-compare-neg-zero`)
* Use brackets if arrow function body could be confused with comparisons (`no-confusing-arrow`)
* No `else` when return is used (`no-else-return`)
* No empty block statements (`no-empty`)
* No type conversion with shorter notations (`no-implicit-coercion`)
* No useless `return` statement (`no-useless-return`)
* No redeclare variables (`no-redeclare`)
